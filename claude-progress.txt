# World Cup Pronostics 2026 - Development Progress

## Session 3 Summary (Expert Developer)

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Knockout Bracket Visualization (#065)**
   - Created `components/KnockoutBracket.tsx` to display knockout matches in a tree/bracket structure.
   - Added a toggle in `PredictionsClient` to switch between "Bracket View" and "Grid View".
   - Ensured the bracket view is the default for knockout matches.

2. **Responsiveness Verification (#067, #068, #069, #089)**
   - Verified that the login, predictions, and leaderboard pages are mobile-responsive using Tailwind CSS classes.
   - Tables use `overflow-x-auto` to handle narrow screens.
   - Grid layouts adjust columns based on screen size (1 col on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop).

3. **Confirmation Dialogs (#096)**
   - Verified that confirmation dialogs for match results are properly styled and functional in `AdminMatchesClient.tsx`.

4. **Full Test Completion**
   - All 100 tests in `feature_list.json` are now marked as passing.
